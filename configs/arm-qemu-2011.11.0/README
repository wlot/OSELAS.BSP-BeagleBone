Some hardware of the real Versatile PB seems not be emulated by QEMU for this
platform:

 - Realtime clock connected via I2C bus.
   The driver fails to detect the Dallas DS1338 RTC

 - Internal flash memory.
   The CFI layer fails to detect the flash memory. Checked with QEMU's
   '-mtdblock' and '-pflash' parameter.
