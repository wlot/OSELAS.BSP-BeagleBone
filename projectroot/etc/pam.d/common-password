# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define the services to be
# used to change user passwords.

# Currently no password changes are allowed durring the authentication process
# because we do not know how it will react with the ldap server if at all
